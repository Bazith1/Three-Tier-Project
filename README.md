Advanced DevSecOps Pipeline with Kubernetes, AWS, and GitOps
Project Introduction:
Welcome to the End-to-End DevSecOps Kubernetes Project guide! In this comprehensive project, we will walk through the process of setting up a robust Three-Tier architecture on AWS using Kubernetes, DevOps best practices, and security measures. This project aims to provide hands-on experience in deploying, securing, and monitoring a scalable application environment.
Project Overview:
In this project, we will cover the following key aspects:
IAM User Setup: Create an IAM user on AWS with the necessary permissions to facilitate deployment and management activities.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use Terraform and AWS CLI to set up the Jenkins server (EC2 instance) on AWS.
Jenkins Server Deployment: Deploy the Jenkins Server using Terraform
Jenkins Server Configuration: Install and configure essential tools on the Jenkins server, including Jenkins itself, Docker, Sonarqube, Terraform, Kubectl, AWS CLI, and Trivy.
EKS Cluster Deployment: Delpoy Amazon EKS cluster, a managed Kubernetes service on AWS using Terraform
Jumper Server Deployment: To communincate EKS Cluster which is in Private Subnet , deploy the Jumper server AWS console
Load Balancer Configuration: Configure AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) for the EKS cluster.
Amazon ECR Repositories: Create private repositories for both frontend and backend Docker images on Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
ArgoCD Installation: Install and set up ArgoCD for continuous delivery and GitOps.
Sonarqube Integration: Integrate Sonarqube for code quality analysis in the DevSecOps pipeline.
Jenkins Pipelines with Github Webhook : Create Jenkins pipelines for deploying backend and frontend code to the EKS cluster with automatic triggering of pipeline using Git Webhook
ArgoCD Application Deployment: Use ArgoCD to deploy the Three-Tier application, including database, backend, frontend, and ingress components.
Monitoring Setup: Implement monitoring for the EKS cluster using Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana.
