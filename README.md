Advanced DevSecOps Pipeline with Kubernetes, AWS, and GitOps

Project Introduction

Welcome to the End-to-End DevSecOps Kubernetes Project guide! This comprehensive project walks you through setting up a robust Three-Tier Architecture on AWS using Kubernetes, DevOps best practices, and advanced security measures. Gain hands-on experience in deploying, securing, and monitoring a scalable application environment.

Project Overview

This project includes the following key components:

1. IAM User Setup

Create an IAM user on AWS with the necessary permissions to facilitate deployment and management activities.

2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Use Terraform and AWS CLI to set up the Jenkins server on an EC2 instance.

3. Jenkins Server Deployment

Deploy the Jenkins Server using Terraform.

4. Jenkins Server Configuration

Install and configure essential tools on the Jenkins server:

Jenkins

Docker

SonarQube

Terraform

Kubectl

AWS CLI

Trivy

5. EKS Cluster Deployment

Deploy an Amazon EKS cluster (managed Kubernetes service) using Terraform.

6. Jumper Server Deployment

Deploy a Jumper Server via the AWS Console to communicate with the EKS cluster located in a private subnet.

7. Load Balancer Configuration

Configure an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) for the EKS cluster.

8. Amazon ECR Repositories

Create private repositories for both frontend and backend Docker images using Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

9. ArgoCD Installation

Install and set up ArgoCD for continuous delivery and GitOps.

10. SonarQube Integration

Integrate SonarQube for code quality analysis in the DevSecOps pipeline.

11. Jenkins Pipelines with GitHub Webhook

Create Jenkins pipelines to:

Deploy backend and frontend code to the EKS cluster.

Automatically trigger the pipeline using GitHub Webhooks.

12. ArgoCD Application Deployment

Use ArgoCD to deploy the Three-Tier application, including:

Database

Backend

Frontend

Ingress Components

13. Monitoring Setup

Implement monitoring for the EKS cluster using:

Helm

Prometheus

Grafana

Prerequisites

AWS Account

Basic knowledge of Kubernetes, Terraform, and Jenkins

Installed tools: AWS CLI, Terraform, Kubectl, Docker

How to Run the Project

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>

Step 2: Setup IAM User

Follow the steps in the documentation to create an IAM user with the necessary permissions.

Step 3: Deploy Jenkins Server

cd terraform/jenkins
terraform init
terraform apply

Step 4: Configure Jenkins Server

Install required tools and plugins as outlined in the project.

Step 5: Deploy EKS Cluster

cd terraform/eks
terraform init
terraform apply

Step 6: Deploy Jumper Server

Deploy the Jumper Server manually via the AWS Console.

Step 7: Configure Load Balancer

Set up the Application Load Balancer using the configuration file provided.

Step 8: Create Docker Images

Build and push Docker images to ECR for the frontend and backend.

Step 9: Install ArgoCD

Deploy ArgoCD to the EKS cluster using the Helm chart provided.

Step 10: Create Jenkins Pipelines

Define pipelines in Jenkins to deploy the backend and frontend code.

Step 11: Deploy Applications with ArgoCD

Use ArgoCD to deploy the database, backend, frontend, and ingress components.

Step 12: Set Up Monitoring

Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using Helm for cluster monitoring.

Monitoring and Alerts

Use Prometheus for metrics collection.

Visualize data with Grafana Dashboards.

Set up alert rules for critical metrics.

Security Measures

Use Trivy for container vulnerability scanning.

Secure AWS resources with IAM policies and roles.

Restrict access to private subnets with a Jumper Server.
